# Kickstarting with Excel

## In this project we are going to be able to review the outcomes of the success, failed, and canceled theater, and plays in the US.

### The purpose is to be able to determine which launch was more successful, failed, and canceled, betwen theater and plays. Also, to find out which months were the best months to lauch and which were the worst.
    The findings for the outcomes based on launch date is that the most succesful month to launch for theater was May and the worst was December.
